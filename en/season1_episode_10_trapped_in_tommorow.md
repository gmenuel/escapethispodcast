The Future



Notes

No special rules here! Just don&#39;t break anything. Unless it feels somehow that you&#39;ve been prompted to do some organised breakage.



# INTRODUCTION

It&#39;s a tragic day for your quaint little town. Your favourite childhood attraction, the Earth of the Future exhibit, is being torn down. Yes, it&#39;s just a single convention hall full of flashing lights, shabby robots and inventions that seemed cool and futuristic in about 1985, but you loved it and are crushed that it&#39;s going to be demolished. The day before it&#39;s due to go down, you call them and ask if there&#39;s any chance you can go in for a last-minute private walk through. To say goodbye.

They say yes.

You arrive in the early evening and walk into the building and towards the exhibit hall, writing a eulogy for the place in your head as you go. You enter through an automatic door at the south end of the room, slightly left of centre. As soon as you do, your feet land on a travelator, a moving walkway. It slowly moves you up the room, rolling you past the exhibits on your left and right. To the left of the door through which you entered is an exhibit labelled &#39;The Family of the Present&#39;, with half a dozen statues in it representing, you guessed it, a modern-ish day family. Then, on the west wall, there are two exhibits displaying two different time periods of the past, showing off their greatest achievements and inventions. The first is an 1800s exhibit, and the second is 1900s. Now, to your right is the centre of the room. Most of its space is taken up by a huge rectangular exhibit that&#39;s been split into six small sections. From this part of the travelator you can see three of these sections: Bedroom of the Future, Bathroom of the Future, and Kitchen of the Future.

As the travelator continues upward, you see that the entire north wall is covered in a mural. The travelator turns right, then right again; this side of the room is a mirror image of the left, only with different exhibits. Against the wall are exhibits for the 2000s and the 2100s, containing models of the designers&#39; predictions for what great inventions will come in the future. The three sections that make up this side of the big centre exhibit are the Yard of the Future, Sports of the Future, and School of the Future. Back on the south wall, directly in front of you, is another automatic door through which you can exit, and beside it is another exhibit, this one labelled &#39;The Family of the Future&#39;.

A heavy sense of loss settles into your stomach. Okay, the entertainment value isn&#39;t great when you look at it with objective eyes, but some of the technology is amazing. The creators have some incredible talent. It&#39;s crazy that they&#39;ve gone so broke the place has to be destroyed – were they never recognised for their genius? Did no one ever give them funding to make their ideas a reality?

Yes, most of the stuff in here is a bit outdated and gimmicky. But there must be something, _something_, that&#39;s worth the world&#39;s attention. Something life-changing. Something that can save this  place, and the livelihoods of its designers.

You think about it as the travelator conveys you towards the exit, when suddenly, the whole thing jerks to a halt. You almost lose your footing. Once you&#39;ve stabilised yourself, you roll your eyes – well, at least it waited until you were finished to break down! Guess you have to use your _feet_ to get to the door. You walk up to it... but it doesn&#39;t open. You try the other door, the entrance one; again, it doesn&#39;t open. Well, this is frustrating. You glance up at the security cameras – five of them, interspersed along the ceiling between exhibits – and give them an urgent wave, trying to get a staff member&#39;s attention, but after several minutes nobody has come to your aid.

Look, in all likelihood, some janitor somewhere will come in here and find you. But you have no idea how long that will take. And this exhibit is being shut down, demolished tomorrow... maybe there aren't any janitors working here anymore. You should probably find a way to get those doors working yourself – it may be the only way to 100% guarantee your safety!

# OBSERVABLE ITEMS

**1800s display:** The triumphs of the 1800s are proudly on show here. The two things they&#39;ve decided to focus on are electricity and the telephone; on one side there&#39;s an enormous electrical generator, and on the other a very old-fashioned phone sitting on a table.

**1900s display:** The great feats of the 1900s represented here are computers and space travel. On one side is a PC, which is somehow both dated and completely novel to you – like it was made by someone who&#39;d done no research whatsoever into what early PCs were like. On the other side is an impressive model rocket that stands about twice as tall as you.

**2000s display:** This display is where they stop focusing on achievements that definitely had a profound impact, and start to take some guesses. Like, they&#39;ve got a humanoid robot on display at one end. At the other end they&#39;ve got a pair of glasses on a pedestal – a pair of Smart Glasses.

**2100s display:** There&#39;s only one thing in this display, and it&#39;s a pretty ambitious prediction: it&#39;s a teleportation machine. This teleporter looks to be made up of two separate chambers – you walk in one and pop out the other – but when you get up close, you see that obviously it&#39;s not real. With a bit of fancy cloth and a mirror, they&#39;ve concealed a narrow passageway that connects the two chambers. A person could just walk through it like any ordinary hallway.

**Bathroom:** There isn&#39;t a huge amount going on here; they didn&#39;t really go to much effort to make it look like a real bathroom. The only focus is their feature item: the Toilet of the Future. There&#39;s a digital screen attached to the toilet, but at the moment it&#39;s blank.

**Bedroom:** There&#39;s a cheap bed, quite dull and obviously just part of the backdrop for the feature item: the Wardrobe of the Future. It&#39;s more or or less a normal wardrobe, full of clothes as wardrobes tend to be, but there&#39;s a screen on the outside. The screen currently says, &quot;DESCRIPTION?&quot; and there&#39;s a touchscreen keypad for you to type letters underneath the word.

**Cameras:** There are five of them spread out across the ceiling, capturing all angles of the room. They&#39;re out of your reach, though, and you aren&#39;t really sure what you&#39;d do with them if you could grab them, anyway.

**Computer:** It&#39;s on, but the screen is totally blank, like nothing whatsoever has been installed. There&#39;s also no mouse. On the tower, though, you see some funny-shaped slots where unusual chips or not-so-universal USBs might fit. The slots look letter-shaped: they resemble A, F, L, R and W.

**Door:** It&#39;s fully automatic; it just isn&#39;t responding to you. There&#39;s no keypad or anything, but obviously there must be _some_ way to get it working again.

**Electricity generator:** It&#39;s off, and you don&#39;t see a switch to turn it on, but it looks kind of real. Like, it isn&#39;t just made of plastic or something. You see a long cable running from the base of it out of the exhibit. If you follow it, you find it attaches to the computer in the 1900s exhibit.

**Family of the future:** The family of the future consists of four beaming people, two adults and two children. It&#39;s clear that they&#39;re meant to all be happy and homogeneous, posing in a line as if for a family photo, with their grinning faces and identical, futuristic jumpsuit-uniforms – the only difference you can see between them is the name sewn into their breast pockets. One&#39;s says &#39;Mary Ellen&#39;, another says &#39;Aaron Luke&#39;, and the third just says &#39;Kelly&#39; – but there&#39;s a glaring problem with that pretty picture: the final family member has been completely stripped of his clothes! How embarrassing.

**Family of the present:** The family of the present is designed to look bothered and unharmonious,  so the family of the future looks better by comparison. It&#39;s two kids, two parents and two grandparents, one male and one female of each. They&#39;re all wearing unhappy expressions and clothes which clash with one another. The father is in black and the mother in blue; the girl child is wearing red, the boy yellow; and the grandfather is in white and the grandmother in stripey purple.

**Kitchen:** The feature futuristic object in the Kitchen of the Future is a device that looks like a cross between a microwave and a vending machine. It&#39;s got a large panel of buttons on its side, both letters and numbers.

**Knowledge chips:** They&#39;re screwed completely tightly into the dummy students&#39; spherical heads. Each one is a perfect M-shape sitting just over the student&#39;s ear, kind of like the original design of Homer Simpson&#39;s hair.

**Mural:** The mural is an enormous cityscape, the CBD of the Future. The entire thing is a visual ode to solar power; buildings are coated in panels, the image of the sun in the top corner has a huge, happy smile painted on it, and all the painted people are staring happily up at it, almost in praise. In fact, on the right there&#39;s a rolling hill with a family picnicking on it, and they&#39;re literally lifting their glasses and saying (in a little speech bubble), &quot;To the sun!&quot;

**Robot:** It seems to be in some kind of sleep mode. You can&#39;t find a start button on it anywhere. There must be some other weird way to get it working. Shame there aren&#39;t any instructions. It&#39;s just standing there, arms stretched out in front of it.

**Rocket:** It&#39;s extremely tall and covered in lights that look like they belong on a Christmas tree. None of them is on, though. Running up the front is a line of several buttons; beside them the words, &quot;What&#39;s your destination?&quot; are painted. Each button is labelled with a different part of the solar system, with Pluto down the very bottom (it&#39;s old, okay?) and the other planets consecutively going up the line. The sun and the moon are also there. These buttons aren&#39;t evenly spaced; they&#39;re roughly working to scale, so the distances between things are different. The moon is quite close to Earth, and of course the sun is waaaay away from everything else – it&#39;s so high it&#39;s basically on the rocket&#39;s nose.

**School:** The classroom itself doesn&#39;t look very futuristic, but then you get a good look at the dummy students sitting at the desks. There&#39;s something attached to each one&#39;s head, right above the ear, something silver. You take a look at the description of this exhibit and read: _Knowledge chips – no teacher required!_

**Smart glasses:** They&#39;re not world-changing, but they are cooler than normal glasses. Part of the frame has two tiny buttons on it – one of them changes the colour tint on the glass, so you can coordinate with any outfit; the other adjusts the fit, so they can sit comfortably on anyone&#39;s face.

**Sports:** This exhibit&#39;s pretty cool – the theme of it is essentially sports without needing all that expensive equipment; there are models of kids in sports uniforms, holding out their arms as if handling baseball bats, but the bats themselves are not physically there – they&#39;re holograms! In fact, apart from the people, everything about the baseball field is a hologram. Bases, ball, a big scoreboard... it&#39;s all very impressive.

**Telephone:** It&#39;s a fair representation of an 1800s-style phone, but there are a few subtle hints that it&#39;s less than genuine. Mainly that there&#39;s a cord running from the bottom of it over to the electricity generator on the other side of the exhibit. You pick up the receiver and hold it to your ear, but hear nothing.

**Yard:** The feature item of the yard-of-the-future is a long device like a robotic lacrosse stick with a tennis ball sitting in it.



# ACTIONS



**Bed – searching underneath it:** Underneath, you spot a folded piece of paper, deliberately discarded. You reach out for it and give it a read:

> Dear Professors Morgan and Karlsen,
> Thank you for the opportunity to let us review your design. Unfortunately I must decline to offer you funding, as I find myself sceptical of certain aspects of your work. Assuming that such an invention is possible – a claim of which I am already extremely doubtful – it is utterly unsafe. Due to that, I cannot in good conscience give my support. Perhaps if your subsequent design attempts include proper insulation, they will be worth my time.
> I regret that we shall not work together,
> 
> Sincerely,
> 
> Doctor Lester Leonidas.

**Computer – inserting M-shaped knowledge chip upside-down into the W-shaped slot:** It fits in perfectly, and words start popping up on the screen. There are two options that appear selectable: one says simply, &quot;Generator – on/off&quot;. It is currently set to &#39;off&#39;&#39;. The other says, &quot;Camera footage&quot;.

**Computer – clicking on &#39;camera footage&#39;:** At first, this looks really promising. Five separate icons show up with the title, &quot;Read Camera \_\_\_&quot;, with the final space occupied by some sort of code name. Each camera must have its own name. Camera 1 is called VAMP, Camera 2 is called PAIL, Camera 3 is TRICKLE, Camera 4 is HOUSE, and Camera 5 is SPRINT. However, if you press &#39;enter&#39; on any of these icons, you are prompted to input a password. There is a password hint available: it says, &quot;Remove the unnecessary.&quot;

**Computer – inputting password &#39;VIRUS&#39; as deduced from the cameras&#39; names:** The camera footage starts loading. In the first lot of footage, you don&#39;t see much of interest. Just several minutes of guests walking through and pointing at the exhibits. You swap to the next video, which is much the same, as are the next two. The final one, though, shows footage of a maintenance worker going about his business after the exhibit has closed. He goes around tidying for a while, then heads over to the small space between the 2000s and 2100s exhibits. He looks up at the ceiling, raises his arms, and reveals a hidden door up into the roof! There must be an inconspicuous maintenance area up there.

**Computer – turning on the electricity generator:  ** Over in the 1800s exhibit, you hear the generator start rumbling.

**Dog toy thrower – taking it and adjusting its settings so it will aim at the &#39;sun&#39; destination on the rocket:  ** It takes you some time to get the settings exactly where you want them, but eventually you&#39;re confident you&#39;ve done it. The ball will definitely hit where you&#39;re aiming.

**Long wire – attempting to loop it around the robot without insulation:** The instant the wire touches the metal robot, you leap a foot in the air as a shock runs through you. You aren&#39;t sure what did it – this sort of electricity stuff is beyond you – but holy cow, it hurt! This seems really unsafe!

**Long wire – coiling wool from the deteriorating scarf  in the wardrobe:** It takes a while to coil it around the entire wire, but you manage to do it, and you&#39;re confident it&#39;s not going to zap you again.

**Long wire – once you&#39;ve added woollen insulation, looping it around the robot, the dog toy thrower, camera 4 and the toilet&#39;s flush:** The wire is _just_ long enough to loop around all of these things, and as soon as it&#39;s in this position... it starts moving. Like it&#39;s on its own mini-conveyor belt. Is it moving on its own? Like, a perpetual motion device? Because... that would _kind of_ be something that would make the inventors rich and famous and powerful.

You return to the maintenance area to satisfy your curiosity.

The light bulb, sitting in its plastic block, is glowing. The movement of the wire is somehow producing enough energy to light it up. You don&#39;t understand it – I mean, nobody does, so that&#39;s fair enough – but the two professors who designed this exhibit have created a working perpetual motion machine. And the exhibit _is_ the machine. There&#39;s no way they can tear this place down now. You&#39;ve done it! You&#39;ve saved this place! Y&#39;know, as long as you can get out.

**Maintenance area – climbing up into it:** You clamber up. The space inside is very cramped and you can&#39;t walk around without hunching. It&#39;s lucky you&#39;re looking downwards, because on the floor right in front of you is a really long coil of wire. Like, _really_ long. Part of it actually loops through the floor, so you can&#39;t see everything it&#39;s connected to, but you could definitely drag most of it around and loop it around things if you want. Attached to some part of the wire is a rectangular block of plastic with a round hole in the top; looking closely, you see a grooved pattern in the hole that makes it look like something&#39;s supposed to screw in there. This block of plastic also has a sticker on it, which has words printed in a tiny font:

RBT – DGTYTHRWR – CMR4 - TLTFLSH

Now, complicated as that is, it&#39;s not the only thing in this little room! On the furthest wall is a sort of electrical circuit board where wires can be plugged into a variety of sockets. Peculiarly, each socket here is a different colour. Lying on the floor underneath, as if recently pulled or knocked out, are three plain wires, much smaller and more normal than the huge one by the entrance. These are double-ended, so each end can plug into a different socket.

**Maintenance area – screwing rocket&#39;s fallen light bulb into the plastic block:** It fits perfectly. **[Note – if players do this AFTER looping the Long Wire around the appropriate items, also read paragraph 3 of &#39;long wire – once you&#39;ve added woollen insulation...&#39;]**

**Meal device – selecting Meal K10, as deduced from the family-of-the-future&#39;s uniform names:** As soon as you&#39;ve pressed the final button, the device whirs, and it spits out a plate triumphantly. Only... that isn&#39;t food on it. Maybe it looked like food once, but time and/or poor mechanics have taken their toll on it, and what was meant to be a plastic representation of a beautiful meal is now a gross-looking lump. On the plate, you see some words: an expiration date. One that&#39;s waaay in the past. Along with this are the words, &quot;Please dispose of this product once expiration date has passed.&quot;

**Robot – handing it the head of one of the dummy students from the school display:** The head fits in the robot&#39;s hands perfectly, and its gears all get to work. It rotates the head until the knowledge chip is pressed into one of its palms, and the palm locks onto it like there&#39;s a magnet in there. Then, it starts rotating, rotating, until the chip has been completely removed from the head. The robot, satisfied with a job well done, drops both.

**Rocket – pressing any destination button other than &#39;sun&#39;:** The rocket rumbles for a moment and makes a blast-off noise, then the whole thing lights up a shining blue/green/red/whatever the appropriate colour for your chosen planet is. As you admire its prettiness, something hits your foot – towards the bottom of the rocket, one of its light bulbs has come loose from all the rumbling and shaking, and has fallen right off.

**Rocket – using the adjusted dog toy thrower to hit the &#39;sun&#39; button:  ** The rocket rumbles for a moment and makes a blast-off noise, then the whole thing starts flashing, a blinding white light. To represent being on the sun, you suppose.  It fills the entire room. You have to shield your eyes, and as you do, you notice something going on in the exhibit against the opposite wall, the 2000s one. It&#39;s the robot – it&#39;s started moving! The flashing light must have turned it on. You walk over to it and observe that its hands are out in front of it, like it&#39;s miming holding a soccer ball.

**Smart glasses – switching their settings so they appear green:** A green light comes over the glasses after you press the buttons, and when you put them on the whole room looks different. In particular, as you peer around, the sports exhibit catches your attention. The holograms were fascinating enough before, but somehow the green light is allowing you to see new details on them. The holographic scoreboard now has words on it – you read, &quot;The ref has called it! 106 to 58!&quot;

**Telephone [AFTER turning on the electricity generator] – dialling 106258, as prompted by the sports holographs:** It rings only once before you hear a voice speaking. They aren&#39;t speaking to you, however; it sounds like a recording. At first it&#39;s a woman&#39;s voice you hear, and it says, &quot;Mother to son, hello.&quot; But then there&#39;s a pause, and a man&#39;s voice speaks. &quot;Father to grandfather, hello.&quot; Another pause, then a girl&#39;s voice says, &quot;Daughter to grandmother, hello.&quot;

**Teleporter – walking through it:** Maybe this looks really cool to people watching you from the outside, but from your perspective, you&#39;re just walking through a short, dark hallway. Right before you come out the other side, your feet get tangled in something. You bend down to grab it, and once you get back into the light, you take a look. It&#39;s a uniform jumpsuit, blue-grey, with a name sewn into the breast pocket: Tom Edward Nathan.

**Toilet – dropping the synthetic meal in and flushing:** The little computerised display flashes the word &#39;PROCESSING&#39; and a percentage bar telling you how much progress it&#39;s made. When it reaches 100%, more words pop up: &#39;ANALYSIS COMPLETE. WARNING: TRACES OF CLOTHING FIBRES IDENTIFIED IN SAMPLE. BE ADVISED TO WEAR STURDY CLOTHING.&#39;

**Wardrobe – typing in that you want a &#39;sturdy&#39; outfit:** A loading screen comes up and you wait, and after about ten seconds a picture of your perfect outfit shows up on the display. As you specified, it does indeed look very sturdy. From the wardrobe it recommends you take a pair of thick, beige pants, black shirt, and huge woolly red scarf, and as an added accessory it tells you to put on a pair of lime green sunglasses.

**Wardrobe – trying on the sturdy outfit it suggests:** The pants and shirt sort of fit, but the scarf is enormous. Also, it&#39;s badly fraying. Pulling on it even slightly makes the whole thing unravel into a long woollen thread.

**Wires – connecting blue socket to yellow, black socket to white, and red socket to striped purple:** Refer to conclusion!

# CONCLUSION

[If you HAVE discovered something that can save the exhibit]

Below you, you hear the sound of mechanical structures shuddering to life. You peer back down the way you came and see the conveyor belt floor is moving once again! You leap out of the maintenance space and rush towards the automatic door, which at long last senses your presence and opens for you. You stand still for a moment, take a deep breath of non-stale air, and then proceed to find a phone so you can start tell the world what you&#39;ve found in here. You&#39;ve saved Professor Morgan and Professor Karlsen&#39;s careers for sure. Maybe you can expect a nice cut of those handsome perpetual motion profits!

[If you HAVE NOT discovered something that can save the exhibit]

Below you, you hear the sound of mechanical structures shuddering to life. You peer back down the way you came and see the conveyor belt floor is moving once again! You leap out of the maintenance space and rush towards the automatic door, which at long last senses your presence and opens for you. You stand still for a moment. Sure, you can go free... but at what cost? The exhibit is still going to be torn down. The professors who built this place are still going to be broke nobodies. You sigh, and turn your back to the open door. Not yet. You can&#39;t leave until you&#39;ve been the hero this place deserves.

# PUZZLE MASTER&#39;S EXPLANATION

There are two main threads you can follow in this one to escape, starting with either the mural or the teleporter. Let&#39;s go with the mural first. It&#39;s got a single theme running through the whole thing: solar power. Everything about it is basically praising the sun. These people would probably live on the sun if they could. With that in mind, you can go to examine the rocket, which has buttons running along its exterior to indicate destination. There&#39;s even a button for the sun – hopefully you realise that&#39;s the one worth pressing. Unfortunately it&#39;s out of reach, right up the top of the rocket. It&#39;s also a very small button, so you&#39;ll need some very specific way to target it. Luckily, in one of the other exhibits, there&#39;s a device that throws a dog&#39;s ball automatically, and it has a really precise in-built targeting system. You program it to throw something at the sun button, and the rocket will start flashing blinding, white light to represent reaching the sun.

Flashing white light just happens to be what resets the robot sitting in this exhibit. This robot is basically a mechanic&#39;s assistant, and it picks up various mechanics-related objects and dismantles them. The things it&#39;s dismantling are all spherical, and it&#39;s taking out all the screws and stuff. Something else in the room that&#39;s spherical with screws and stuff attached? The heads of the students in the school-of-the-future exhibit, with &#39;knowledge chips&#39; attached above their ears. These heads are easily removable, and if you hand one to the robot, it will pull the chip right off.

This chip is M-shaped. Since it&#39;s a computer chip, your first instinct is hopefully to take it to the computer. There&#39;s no M-shaped slot, sadly, but there are a few other letters – one being W-shaped. So you simply flip your chip upside-down and insert it. The computer can turn on the electricity to the 1800s exhibit, including the phone. So you now have a sort-of working phone, which is good. The computer can also show you footage from the security cameras, if you input a password. Each camera has a codename – Vamp, Pail, Trickle, House and Sprint – and there&#39;s a hint for the password that tells you to _remove the unnecessary_. Each of these code names can have a letter removed and still form a real word. Like, &#39;trickle&#39; can remove the R to form &#39;tickle&#39;. I think the only one with two options is &#39;pail&#39;, which could form either &#39;pal&#39; or &#39;ail&#39;, but if you look at all the letters you remove, you&#39;ll notice they spell something. Remove the V to form &#39;amp&#39;, the I to form &#39;pal&#39;, R to form &#39;tickle&#39;, U to form &#39;hose&#39;, and S to form &#39;print&#39;, and you get VIRUS. This is the password.

If you watch the security footage, you&#39;ll notice there&#39;s video of a maintenance worker entering a hidden door in the ceiling, to a special work area. Now that you know where it is, you can find it and climb up. In this work space, you find three wires that have been pulled from their coloured sockets. These will reactivate the doors for you, but you have no idea which sockets the wires should go in.

To figure it out, we&#39;re going to have to go all the way back to the teleporter. It&#39;s not real, of course, just a hidden room between two &#39;teleportation points&#39;, and inside this room is a uniform that matches those in the family-of-the-future exhibit. Each of these uniforms is identical except for the person&#39;s name sewn into the front (Mary Ellen, Aaron Luke, Kelly, and Tom Edward Nathan). Taking the initials of these names spells MEAL K TEN, which is a code you can type into the dial-a-meal device in the kitchen of the future. If you order Meal K10, the device shoots out a gross-looking, synthetic ball that may have once resembled food. Printed on one small part of its surface is an expiry date, one that has most definitely passed, along with a recommendation to dispose of this product immediately when expired. Where in this room might one dispose of something? The toilet!

The smart toilet in the bathroom-of-the-future exhibit analyses whatever&#39;s flushed in it, so if you dispose of the synthetic ball, it will warn you that some clothing fibres have been identified, so your clothes must be falling apart. It recommends you change into some sturdy clothes. Now you can go to the wardrobe-of-the-future and request a &#39;sturdy&#39; outfit. It will toss some clothes at you and recommend lime green sunglasses to go with them. Luckily, the smart glasses in another display have a setting that can change their colour.

If you wear the green glasses, the sports-of-the-future display opposite you starts to look different. It&#39;s all holographic, and suddenly the green makes some new holographs appear. You see some words: &quot;The ref has called it! 106 to 58!&quot; The word _called_ hopefully tells you that this is relevant to the phone. Now that it has electricity, you can call 106258 on it (literally, 106 to [meaning 2] 58), and you&#39;ll hear some automated voices coming through it. They say, &quot;Mother to son, hello.&quot; &quot;Father to grandfather, hello.&quot; &quot;Daughter to grandmother, hello.&quot;

The display of the family-of-the-present has all these family members. Unlike the family of the future, these people are all wearing different colours. Their colours match those of the wires in the work space you found earlier. For instance, the mother is wearing blue and the son is wearing yellow, so one of the wires has to connect the blue and yellow sockets. Father to grandfather means black to white, and daughter to grandmother means red to striped purple. Once the wires are in place, the door will open and you will be out!

HOWEVER. While this would be a nice, neat escape, you also have a secondary objective. You want to save the exhibit, which means finding something hidden in it that is of such scientific genius that it can&#39;t possibly be destroyed. None of the regular exhibits fit the bill; they&#39;re only _okay._ Your first hint about this hidden genius invention comes from under the bed in the Bedroom-of-the-future, which is a discarded letter from a notable doctor to the professors who designed the exhibit. He&#39;s rejecting their call for funding, because their design is unlikely to work and is unsafe because it has no insulation. This doesn&#39;t mean much yet, but it&#39;s good to keep in mind.

The next thing you need comes from the rocket. Pressing the &#39;sun&#39; button helped us with the robot, but what if you press a different destination? The whole rocket rumbles, and as it does so, one of its little light bulbs falls off. You should pocket it.

Now, finally, we come to the maintenance area. Along with the wires that help you escape, there was some funny wire contraption going on: a really long wire that hooks through the floor, and a small plastic block attached to it. That light bulb you got from the rocket can screw into the plastic, so that&#39;s something. There&#39;s also a sticker on the plastic with some gibberish words on it – it&#39;s pretty easy to translate, considering it&#39;s just listing four objects in the room minus the vowels. Robot, dog toy thrower, camera 4, and toilet flush. These are the objects you need to loop the really long wire around for something to happen...

But if you try, you&#39;ll get an electric shock from the robot! Wire on metal doesn&#39;t go well in this circuit, apparently. To make this work, you&#39;ll need some sort of... insulation. Just like the letter you found said.

But where can you get insulation material? Actually, the thing to use is something suggested to you much earlier, by the wardrobe-of-the-future. One of the pieces of clothing it suggested to you was a big wool scarf, but if you find it, you&#39;ll notice it&#39;s unravelling rapidly. An unravelled wool scarf makes a great insulating material, and you can wrap it around the whole wire.

Now that you&#39;re not getting electrocuted, you can finish looping the wire. And when you do, you discover that this room is home to a miracle of science – it&#39;s a perpetual motion machine. A real one. And this means they can&#39;t _possibly_ tear the exhibit down. Secondary goal achieved!
